#README

In order to run the project entirely and explore all outputs as expected (namely the full dataset classification), please do the following:
- download the zipped project directory
- unzip the project directory
- download the archive folder from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JVDyh_28Y7k3Km4BQIYwjhqPMIH73jb0?usp=sharing, in order to obtain the additional images to be processed in the notebook
- unzip the archive folder and move the unziped directory to the previously downloaded and unzipped project directory
- when moving, the file explorer will ask if the archive folder already present in the project folder 
should be substituted by the new archive folder you are moving in. Select "yes" and substitute the archive folder by the new downloaded one


IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE THE ARCHIVE DIRECTORY IS IN THE SAME DIRECTORY LEVEL AS G02.ipynb AND THAT YOU SUBSTITUTE THE ARCHIVE FOLDER BY THE DOWNLOADED ONE. 
THE NAME OF THE ARCHIVE FOLDER SHOULD BE 'archive'

The expected file structure is:

- project_dir (unzipped)
   - G02.ipynb
   - ...
   - archive (unzipped)
       - [image folders]


Happy programming :D
